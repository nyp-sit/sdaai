# Specialist Diploma for Applied AI (FAQ)

## Course Application

Question: I wanted to know if a non technical background person would be suitable. I do have self learnt skills in Power BI and other basic automations on Power Automate. 
- Our course is intended for those who build AI systems including Generative AI solutions.  It is not intended for end user who just need to use tools for their daily work.  That is why our MER has stipulated that a technical background in Engineering and IT is required. 

Question: I saw that there are 2 intakes for this Specialist Diploma, in Oct 2025 and Apr 2026. To obtain this Specialist Diploma, do I have to enroll in sequence of Apr then Oct, following the Poly Academic Year or I just need to complete the Oct PDC and then the Apr PDC? Is it that the PDC doesn’t depends on each other and can be taken in any sequences?
- You are right that we have a October 2025 intake for PDC2 - PDC in generative AI & deep learning and the April 2026 intake for PDC1-  PDC in Machine learning & Operations. You do not have to enrol in sequence, although we do recommend candidates who have no exposure to machine learning and python to first take PDC1 and then PDC2. However, we also have many candidates who successfully completed PDC2 first then PDC1. You only need to enrol in one of the PDC and we will do the progression to the other PDC. 

## Course

Question: Where can I find more information about the course?
- You can find out more about the course and apply at the STEP portal, using this [link](https://stms.polite.edu.sg/student/ihlcourse/detail/9478b234-72fb-48c3-b2c6-156f034fadd4)

Question: Can you describe some hands-on projects assigned for covering the key modules? What types of projects or capstone assignments will be part of the course? Will the course include individual or group-based project work?Will the course focus on specific frameworks/libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face)? Is there any intense coding work involved?
Ans: Our course is not designed to teach end user how to use the tools, but more targeted towards training builders who can build model and tools that are specific to a use case, for example in an enterprise use. Due to diverse range of industry/sectors, we are unlikely to cover all kinds in our lab practicals, but will try to give different use cases for the exercises. For project module, usually 2 to 3 people will work on a proposed project, with the guidance of project mentor. This is where student can come up with innovative ideas, in any industry/sector and  work on implementing a MVP. We will occasionally invite industry partners to give talks to our students. 

## Credit Transfer

Qns: May I check if I can transfer my PDC with another polytechnic on Cloud-based Machine Learning to any relevant Specialist Diplomas offered by NYP?
Ans: To be considered for credit transfer, we will need very close alignment with the target module, in terms of content coverage, and the assessment scope and rigor.  Alternatively, we can consider module exemption instead of credit transfer. For consideration of module exemption/credit transfer (MECT), we will need the module learning outcomes, and the topics covered, course hours.

## Attendance 

Qns: What are the maximum number of classes that we may be allowed to miss in case of work exigencies? 
Ans: The minimum attendance is 50% for every module. If attendance is less than 50%, the student will get maximum a non-graded pass.

Qns: Are the classes fixed on every Mon, Wed & Thurs from 6.30pm to 9.30pm? As I knock off from work only at 6pm, is there any penalty for late sign-in for classes either at NYP or online? 
Ans: There is no penalty for late sign-in. We are using SSG QR code attendance system, which allows student to sign in 30 minutes before the class starts and 30 minutes after the class ends. 

## Laptop Requirement

Qns: Understand that a personal PC or laptop with NVIDIA GPU is needed for PDC2, I would like to check if IGPU PC is good enough? If not, I will explore PC/laptop with dedicated GPU. 
Ans: Integrated graphics won’t help much in terms of compute acceleration. Most training framework works best when using NVIDIA GPU, although AMD now can also be supported through the use of ROCM, but they are not as widely supported as compared to NVIDIA (and not so stable as well). For our course, most of the time you can just use the free GPU resources available on Google Colab or Kaggle, and for project, we also cater additional GPU resources if necessary.  So there is not really a need to purchase any GPU laptop. However. If you would like to experiment with setting up a deep learning environment, for your own purposes and for some weekend projects, an NVIDIA GPU will be very helpful.
