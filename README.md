## Course Application

### CA-Q1
**Question**: I am interested in this course specialist diploma in applied artificial intelligence. May I know when is the next available schedule date for this course to start? 
- We have refreshed our curriculum for Specialist Diploma in Applied AI and it now comprises two new PDCS. You can find out more from the course page at STEP portal, using the below links.
   - PDC in Machine Learning & Operations - https://stms.polite.edu.sg/student/ihlcourse/detail/0ca3bf9a-1d0e-4671-8c90-98fb9f3df72f
   - PDC In Generative AI & Deep Learning - https://stms.polite.edu.sg/student/ihlcourse/detail/9478b234-72fb-48c3-b2c6-156f034fadd4

### CA-Q2
**Question**: I wanted to know if a non technical background person would be suitable. I do have self learnt skills in Power BI and other basic automations on Power Automate. 
- Our course is intended for those who build AI systems including Generative AI solutions.  It is not intended for end user who just need to use tools for their daily work.  That is why our MER has stipulated that a technical background in Engineering and IT is required. 

### CA-Q3
**Question**: I saw that there are 2 intakes for this Specialist Diploma, in Oct 2025 and Apr 2026. To obtain this Specialist Diploma, do I have to enroll in sequence of Apr then Oct, following the Poly Academic Year or I just need to complete the Oct PDC and then the Apr PDC? Is it that the PDC doesn’t depends on each other and can be taken in any sequences?
- You are right that we have a October 2025 intake for PDC2 - PDC in generative AI & deep learning and the April 2026 intake for PDC1-  PDC in Machine learning & Operations. You do not have to enrol in sequence, although we do recommend candidates who have no exposure to machine learning and python to first take PDC1 and then PDC2. However, we also have many candidates who successfully completed PDC2 first then PDC1. You only need to enrol in one of the PDC and we will do the progression to the other PDC.

### CA-Q4
**Question**: I would like to enquire about the “Diploma in AI” for 6 months day time courses using skills future credit and training allowance.
- We are offering Specialist Diploma in Applied AI as an evening part-time course, which comprises of two PDCs, spreading over a year to complete. We don’t offer day-time course.

### CA-Q5
**Question**: I understand that the Specialist Diploma is made up of two PDCs but wanted to clarify if we intend to graduate with the diploma, does that mean we apply separately for the PDC during the respective Oct/Apr course runs? Are there further requirements in order to graduate with a diploma and not just the individual certificates themselves? 
- You don't have to apply separately for the PDC.  As long as you are enrolled into one of the PDC, we will automatically progress you to the next PDC, and you will graduate with a Specialist Diploma after you have completed two PDCs. There is no other requirements other than passing the two PDCs.

### CA-Q6
**Question**: I have just applied through the STMS portal. May I know how long the process of applications usually takes?
- You should be able to know your application result, a few weeks before the new semester starts in mid-April or mid-October. Once it is successful, you will receive the notification of the offer and you can accept (or reject) the offer and then make the fee payment.

## Course 

### C-Q1
**Question**: Where can I find more information about the course?
- You can find out more about the course and apply at the STEP portal, using this [link](https://stms.polite.edu.sg/student/ihlcourse/detail/9478b234-72fb-48c3-b2c6-156f034fadd4)

### C-Q2
**Question**: Can you describe some hands-on projects assigned for covering the key modules? What types of projects or capstone assignments will be part of the course? Will the course include individual or group-based project work?Will the course focus on specific frameworks/libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face)? Is there any intense coding work involved?
- Our course is not designed to teach end user how to use the tools, but more targeted towards training builders who can build model and tools that are specific to a use case, for example in an enterprise use. Due to diverse range of industry/sectors, we are unlikely to cover all kinds in our lab practicals, but will try to give different use cases for the exercises.
- For project module, usually 2 to 3 people will work on a proposed project, with the guidance of project mentor. This is where student can come up with innovative ideas, in any industry/sector and  work on implementing a MVP. We will occasionally invite industry partners to give talks to our students.

### C-Q3
**Question**: Can I check if the mode of learning for this Specialist Diploma - how much am I required to be on campus? 
- The classes are conducted in a hybrid mode, i.e. face-to-face and online via Zoom at the same time. The sessions are also being recorded. The classes are usually conducted on every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday during the semester. This is subjected to changes, please refer to the Learning Unit Plan for the detailed information. You'll need to have at least 50% attendance to pass the module.

### C-Q4
**Question**: Is there an exam component to this or is it mostly project based?
- The learning units will consist of tests and assignment. There is also a project-based learning unit where you will be working with 2 to 3 people on a proposed project with the guidance of project mentor(s). 

## Credit Transfer

### CT-Q1
**Question**: May I check if I can transfer my PDC with another polytechnic on Cloud-based Machine Learning to any relevant Specialist Diplomas offered by NYP?
- To be considered for credit transfer, we will need very close alignment with the target module, in terms of content coverage, and the assessment scope and rigor.  Alternatively, we can consider module exemption instead of credit transfer. For consideration of module exemption/credit transfer (MECT), we will need the module learning outcomes, and the topics covered, course hours.

## Exemption
### E-Q1
**Question**: I would like to find out what are the modules that I can be exempted from the courses for Specialist Diploma in Applied Artificial Intelligence as I completed Specialist Diploma in Business and Big Data Analytics at NYP last semester.
- For our PDC in Machine Learning & Operations, we can consider module exemption for one of the module (Applied Machine Learning). For PDC in Generative AI & Deep Learning, we are unable to extend any module exemption.

## Deferment & Withdrawal
### DW-Q1
**Question**: Can I withdraw from the course after my application?
- There will be no refund for any deferment or withdrawal after the course has started. You can submit your deferment / withdrawal request through STEP portal.
- Please note that a 100% refund will be available if the withdrawal request is submitted more than or equal to 14 days before the course start date. And a 50% refund will be available if the withdrawal request is submitted less than 14 days before the course start date.


## Attendance 

### ATT-Q1
**Question**: What are the maximum number of classes that we may be allowed to miss in case of work exigencies? 
- The minimum attendance is 50% for every module. If attendance is less than 50%, the student will get maximum a non-graded pass.

### ATT-Q2
**Question**: Are the classes fixed on every Mon, Wed & Thurs from 6.30pm to 9.30pm? As I knock off from work only at 6pm, is there any penalty for late sign-in for classes either at NYP or online? 
- There is no penalty for late sign-in. We are using SSG QR code attendance system, which allows student to sign in 30 minutes before the class starts and 30 minutes after the class ends. 

## Laptop Requirement

### LR-Q1
**Question**: Understand that a personal PC or laptop with NVIDIA GPU is needed for PDC2, I would like to check if IGPU PC is good enough? If not, I will explore PC/laptop with dedicated GPU. 
- Integrated graphics won’t help much in terms of compute acceleration. Most training framework works best when using NVIDIA GPU, although AMD now can also be supported through the use of ROCM, but they are not as widely supported as compared to NVIDIA (and not so stable as well).
- For our course, most of the time you can just use the free GPU resources available on Google Colab or Kaggle, and for project, we also cater additional GPU resources if necessary.  So there is not really a need to purchase any GPU laptop. However. If you would like to experiment with setting up a deep learning environment, for your own purposes and for some weekend projects, an NVIDIA GPU will be very helpful.

### LR-Q2
**Question**: What is the laptop requirement for this Specialist Diploma? 
- Lab PCs will be provided for in-class lessons. Personal PC or laptop will be required for you to complete your assignment or for hands-on during Zoom lessons.
- Recommended personal PC/laptop specifications: Intel i7 processor or better, 16GB RAM or more, NVIDIA GPU (optional, for PDC2 only)

## Progression

### Pro-Q1
**Question**: For the previous pdc, would nyp gives us physical certificate of completion/transcript? If yes, how to collect it?
- Physical certificate will not be issued.  All the certificates will be issued as OpenCert.  You can choose to download or print the opencert on your own.

### Pro-Q2
**Question**: If I have completed the PDC, do I need to register for the next PDC? 
- After the release of the semester result, Students who have successfully completed the current PDC, would be enrolled to the next PDC. 
- For those non-company sponsored students, we will help you with registration for next PDC. Once it is approved, you will receive the notification of the offer and you can accept (or reject) the offer and then make the fee payment.
- For those company-sponsored students, we have uploaded your name for sponsorship and have informed your company HR to verify the sponsorship.
